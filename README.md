- this project was done by following the AMM and Kitties tutorial on figment
- The NFT Part works and a pallet for that was created (check the pallet part)
- The pallet for the AMM was created by following the tutorials on substrate and AMM Tutorial on Figment. The ink part was translated to a pallet :-)
- The coupling part is not working. I tried various thins, but didnt succeed in that.

What is needed:

- the two pallets should be coupled (i tried to play with tightly coupling but everything went wrong)
- The price oracle is not solved --> using some kind offchain oracle would be an overkill for me.
- The tests are not fine at the moment as i did struggle with the basics.

The project was a total overkill for my current skillset and after the two first days of depression, I started to make some progress.
I kind of now understand how everything works and fit together, but im far of being confortable to develop on frame.
I guess with some practice it should be possible.

Still feeling stupid, but atleast less stupid then on saturday. :-)
