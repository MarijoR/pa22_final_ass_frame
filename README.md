- this project was done by following the AMM and Kitties tutorial on figment
- The NFT Part works and a pallet for that was created (check the pallet part)
- The pallet for the AMM was created by following the tutorials on substrate and AMM Tutorial on Figment.
- There was even i try of tight coupling by following the live coding session of Shawn but i dont think it works as it should be

The project was a total overkill for my current skillset and after the two first days of depression, I started to make some progress.
I guess it was not really good idea to isolate myself and try to understand everything. It would have made more sense to talk to TA-s
I kind of now understand how everything works and fit together, but im far of being confortable to develop on frame.
I guess with some practice it should be possible.

Still feeling stupid, but atleast less stuopid then on saturday. :-)
